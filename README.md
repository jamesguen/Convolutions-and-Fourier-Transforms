README: Signal and Image Processing Document
Overview
This document provides a comprehensive exploration of signal and image processing concepts, focusing on the mathematical and computational frameworks used for analyzing and manipulating signals and images. Key topics include:

Fourier Transform:

Decomposition of signals into sinusoidal components.
Interpretation of frequency, magnitude, and phase.
Laplace Transform:

Generalization of the Fourier Transform for analyzing systems with exponential growth or decay.

Convolution:
Interactive Convolution Demonstration
For an interactive demonstration of convolution, visit the following Desmos link: [Interactive Convolution Visualization](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8son10p7ak) on Desmos

This interactive tool allows users to experiment with signals and kernels, visualizing the convolution process dynamically.
